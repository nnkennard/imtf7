# About the bawarchi

I do not have a name yet. We are looking at Bawarchi, Maharaj, Dude (Meghna’s Choice). If anyone has any suggestions, please email Karen at imissthatfood@gmail.com. I would like a name which means Cook/Chef in any Indian language.

When Karen bought her first Cake Decorating Book in 1982, she painted me on a piece of card-paper. I worked as a book-mark there for many many years!

Then early this year, I got a new life ... Karen animated me, and this is my new avataar, I am here to welcome you to Karen’s new site. Enjoy browsing, and more than that, enjoy cooking and eating! 

# About this website

My daughter Neha made this website. She says "This website was made between bouts of crying during a 4-month sleep regression. Some of the code is embarrassing. Any complaints about the website code or design are probably deserved but unlikely to be addressed."
