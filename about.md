title: About I Miss That Food

Imissthatfood was started way back in 1999. We had just moved to Singapore and my sisters would call and ask for recipes. So I decided, the easiest way to do this was to put all the recipes online, in effect, an online recipe book. In its initial avatar it was a free site on yahoo geocities… long defunct!

Later I bought the domain name and converted the website to its current form… albeit more basic.

Imissthatfood has recipes from both sides of the family. Konkani favourites from Chandru’s side and Bombay favourites from mine. As we moved and travelled widely, we tasted and enjoyed many different cuisines. I experimented and what appears here are our favourites, tried and tested many times over.

# About the bawarchi

I do not have a name yet. We are looking at Bawarchi, Maharaj, Dude (Meghna’s Choice). If anyone has any suggestions, please email Karen at imissthatfood@gmail.com. I would like a name which means Cook/Chef in any Indian language.

When Karen bought her first Cake Decorating Book in 1982, she painted me on a piece of card-paper. I worked as a book-mark there for many many years!

Then early this year, I got a new life ... Karen animated me, and this is my new avataar, I am here to welcome you to Karen’s new site. Enjoy browsing, and more than that, enjoy cooking and eating! 

# About this website

My daughter Neha made this website. She says "This website was made between bouts of crying during a 4-month sleep regression. Some of the code is embarrassing. Any complaints about the website code or design are probably deserved but unlikely to be addressed."
