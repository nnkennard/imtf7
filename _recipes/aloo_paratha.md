# Ingredients

* potatoes - 2
* Onion - 1
* Green chillies finely cut
* coriander leaves finely cut
* curry leaves finely cut
* 1/2 tsp. garam masala powder
* Hing
* oil
* mustard seeds
* garam masala powder

# Method

Make a chapati dough.

Cook alu, peel and grate or mash.

Heat oil, add mustard. When the mustard pops, add onion (finely cut) and green chillies.

When the onion bits are transparent add coriander leaves, curry leaves, garam masala powder and salt.

Mix mashed potato and hing.

Make a lime sized ball of chappatti dough.

Roll into a small puri.

Keep a lump of potato mixture in the middle and bring together the ends of the puri so that a ball is formed.

Roll, dusting in wheat flour.  Roast with ghee on a flat tava.

I make two puris, put the potato mixture in the middle of one, dampen the edges with a little water, and place the second puri on top. Then cut off the excess dough with a pizza cutter/knife. Roll and roast. This way you do not get any thick doughy parts.
