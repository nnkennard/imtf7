# Ingredients

* 250 gm corn
* 1 potato
* 2 slices of bread shredded fine
* 4 green chillies chopped fine
* 1 tablespoon chopped coriander
* 1 tablespoon garam masala
* 1 tablespoon lemon juice
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1/2 teaspoon chilli powder
* 1 teaspoon crushed ginger
 

# Method

Grind the corn into a paste without adding any more water.

 Add boiled and mashed potato, bread, chopped green chillies,coriander, garam masala, lemon juice, salt, chilli powder and crushed ginger.

Mix well.

Make this mixture into sausage like rolls, and shallow fry lightly.

Then stick them onto wooden skewers and grill.

Keep the mixture as dry as possible or else it does not hold it's shape.

In an emergency you can add some cornflour, but then the taste changes and you will also have to adjust the salt.

Remember to soak the skewers in water earlier, so that they don't burn while grilling.
