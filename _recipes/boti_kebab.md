This is a blander version of what we would eat at the "kaleji wallahs" at Hill Road. If you appreciate spice add 1 teaspoon chilli powder and one chopped chilli to the marinade. Serve with naan, pudina chutney and tamarind chutney.

# Ingredients

* 500 grams mutton pieces
* 2 tablespoons dessicated coconut
* I large onion roughly chopped
* 2 cloves garlic peeled
* 1 teaspoon chopped ginger
* 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
* 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
* 1/4 teaspoon cardamom
* 1/4 teaspoon cloves
* 1/2 teaspoon coarsely ground pepper
* 1 teaspoon poppy seeds
* 1/2 cup yoghurt

# Method
Trim excess fat off mutton pieces. If you would like it crisp, leave a thin layer of fat . Cut into small bite sized cubes.

Toast coconut over medium-heat till golden brown. Cool.

Blend together onion, garlic and ginger till smooth.

Add the spices and the toasted coconut, the poppy seeds and the yoghurt and blend till the coconut is fine.

Pour over the meat, rub the marinade into each piece and cover and leave to marinate overnight in the refrigerator or at least 2 hours outside.

Grill on wooden skewers.

Remember to soak the skewers in water earlier, so that they don't burn while grilling.
