# Ingredients

* 1 kilo chicken (boneless, cubed)
* 1 teaspoon garlic crushed
* 1 teaspoon ginger crushed
* 1 tablespoon chopped coriander
* 1 table spoon chopped chillies
* 1 teaspoon garam masala
* 1 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1 1/2 teaspoon chilli powder
* mace
* 1/2 cup yoghurt
* tandoori colour  
 

# Method

Mix all ingredients together well.

Then add the meats and marinate.

Chicken 2-6 hours Other meats 8-10 hours.

Grill 10-12 minutes on each side and brush with ghee.

Alternatively bake in a hot oven for 15-20 minutes.        

_Remember to soak the skewers in water earlier, so that they don't burn while grilling._

_It is easier to cut the chicken into cubes while still frozen. Use a chopper or a chef's knife, but be very careful, as the knife can slip._
